🛒 Valhalla Market
Valhalla Market is a frontend-based web project built to provide a seamless shopping experience for Telegram users. This website was created so that users on Telegram can easily order food or clothes without leaving the Telegram app — fully integrated via Web App functionality.

🎯 Purpose
The main purpose of this web app is to allow Telegram users to:

1. Order food and drinks
2. Shop for men's and women's t-shirts
3. Do all of the above directly from Telegram without switching apps

The web interface is kept clean, minimal, and fully functional using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no external images or complex frameworks.

🚀 Features
🔐 Simulated “Connect Wallet” login (no real wallet required)

📦 Interactive dashboard for selecting menu item
👕 Men’s T-Shirt Store (shirt.html)
👚 Ladies’ T-Shirt Store (shirt-women.html)
🧭 Simple navigation across all pages (Login ↔ Dashboard ↔ Shirt Pages)
🛒 Buy buttons that confirm your selected item and price via pop-up 
🎨 Fully custom styled using HTML + CSS (no images used)
